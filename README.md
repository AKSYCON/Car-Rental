🚗 **Car Rental Management System – Full-Stack Web Application (Angular + .NET Core)**
I developed a fully-featured Car Rental Web Application using Angular (frontend) and .NET Core Web API (backend) to manage the complete rental process for users and administrators. This project mimics real-world rental service platforms with clean UI, robust backend, and secure user management.

🔍 Project Overview:
The application enables end-to-end functionality for car rental services, designed to serve both customers and admin users with tailored interfaces and role-based access.

👨‍💻 User Functionality:
User Registration & Authentication: Secure sign-up and login using JWT tokens.

Search & Filter Vehicles: Browse and filter available cars by brand, type, location, price, and date.

Booking System: Users can book a car by choosing pickup and drop-off dates.

Booking Management: View, manage, and cancel existing bookings.

Responsive UI: Fully mobile-friendly with a modern design using Angular Material.

🛠️ Admin Functionality:
Admin Login Portal: Secure backend access with role-based permissions.

Car Fleet Management: Add, update, or delete car listings (including images and specs).

Booking Overview: View and manage all active, past, or cancelled bookings.

User Monitoring: See active users and their booking history.

Dashboard View: Visual overview of revenue metrics, and booking trends.

🧪 Tech Stack:
Frontend: Angular 14+, Angular Material, Bootstrap

Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 6)

Database: Microsoft SQL Server with Entity Framework Core

Authentication: JWT Token-based secure login system

API Layer: RESTful services for all CRUD operations


📦 Features in Progress / Future Enhancements:
